//! UTSUSHI-211 — RealLive `module_sel` (choice / selection) RLOperation
//! family.
//!
//! Implements the EXACT rlvm `Sel`-module opcode set `{0,1,2,3,4,14,20}`:
//! the SELECT ops `select`, `select_s`, `select_w`, `select_s` (opcode `3`),
//! `select_objbtn`, `select_objbtn_cancel` plus the `objbtn_init` setup op.
//! Each SELECT opcode yields a
//! [`crate::rlop::longops::SelectLongOp`] carrier whose private state
//! holds the choice byte strings and a pending chosen-index sentinel.
//! The substrate's [`crate::rlop::LongOpScheduler`] decides when the
//! head longop becomes `Ready` — the [`ChoiceInputScheduler`] this module
//! ships flips `Ready` once an [`InputEvent::Choice`]
//! ([`utsushi_core::substrate::ChoiceIndex`]) is fed through
//! [`ChoiceInputScheduler::record_choice`].
//!
//! On resume, the VM's [`crate::vm::Vm::step`] decodes the popped longop's
//! private state and writes the chosen index into the store register
//! (`vm.banks().store()`), keeping the longop coupling honest: the audit
//! focus pinned by UTSUSHI-211 ("Longop coupling — the longop must use
//! the substrate scheduler, not a private wait loop") is enforced
//! structurally — there is no per-op wait loop, the chosen index lives
//! on the scheduler until the substrate poll returns `Ready`, and the
//! store-register write happens through the same dispatch path as every
//! other substrate effect.
//!
//! # Module addressing
//!
//! The choice family lives at `(module_type=0, module_id=2)` — the REAL
//! RealLive `Sel` module (matching rlvm's `RLModule("Sel", 0, 2)` and the
//! `kaifuu-reallive` decompiler). This was VALIDATED against real bytecode:
//! surveying all 198 Sweetie HD scenes, every one of the 117 real
//! selects is `select_w` at `(module_type=0, module_id=2, opcode=2)`, each
//! framed with a `{ … }` option block. An earlier revision registered the
//! family at `module_type=1` (a WRONG constant misread from a
//! `(1, 5, opcode=120)` `SYS2` byte at Sweetie HD scene 1 offset `0x001e`);
//! that mis-registration meant the real `(0, 2, 2)` selects never
//! dispatched through this pipeline — they were gap-filled by
//! [`crate::rlop::module_catalog`] as `Advance` no-ops, leaving the choice
//! machinery DORMANT on real bytes (recognized 0-unknown, but never
//! presented, never driving a branch). Corrected to `module_type=0`.
//!
//! The registered opcode set is EXACTLY rlvm's `Sel` module `{0,1,2,3,4,14,20}`
//! (verified against `rlvm/src/src/modules/module_sel.cc` — see below); there
//! is no synthetic opcode `120` (rlvm registers no such opcode and no real
//! corpus tuple lands on `(0,2,120)`).
//!
//! NOTE (pre-existing `0/1/2` naming, out of this node's scope): the port's
//! variant NAMES for opcodes `0/1/2` (`select` / `select_s` / `select_w`) do
//! NOT line up with rlvm's `module_sel.cc` labels (`0`=`select_w`, `1`=`select`,
//! `2`=`select_s2`, `3`=`select_s`). The opcode NUMBERS registered are what
//! matters for dispatch; every port SELECT opcode funnels through the same
//! [`SelectLongOp`] carrier, so the label mismatch is cosmetic. This node
//! adds opcodes `3` + `14` to reach exact rlvm coverage and does not re-label
//! `0/1/2` (that would churn the real-bytes-anchored `select_w`=`(0,2,2)`
//! documentation and is tracked separately).
//!
//! # Opcode coverage (rlvm `SelModule` — `module_sel.cc`)
//!
//! | Opcode | rlvm name              | Port variant                       |
//! | ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
//! | `0`    | `select_w`             | [`SelectVariant::Select`]          |
//! | `1`    | `select`               | [`SelectVariant::SelectS`]         |
//! | `2`    | `select_s2`            | [`SelectVariant::SelectW`]         |
//! | `3`    | `select_s`             | [`SelectVariant::SelectS3`]        |
//! | `4`    | `select_objbtn`        | [`SelectVariant::SelectObjbtn`]    |
//! | `14`   | `select_objbtn_cancel` | [`SelectVariant::SelectObjbtnCancel`] |
//! | `20`   | `objbtn_init`          | [`ObjbtnInitOp`] (setup, not a select) |
//!
//! # Choice MODALITY — the graphical / text split (real-bytes-derived)
//!
//! WHICH graphical presentation a select renders as is NOT a function of the
//! option count (the retired heuristic). It is derived from the surrounding
//! [`SelectionControl`] button-setup ops — see [`SelectionControlSignal`] and
//! [`select_modality`]. Surveying all 198 real Sweetie HD scenes, the
//! button-object SelectionControl setup ops are `objbtn_init` (`(0,2,20)`,
//! 43×) and `select_objbtn` (`(0,2,4)`, 33×). A select that sits in a scene
//! carrying those ops is a GRAPHICAL button-object select; a select with no
//! such setup is a plain vertical TEXT list. The count-based route-vs-clothing
//! split had no real-bytes basis (a 2-option and a ≥3-option select are the
//! same `select_w` opcode) and is removed. NOTE (honest finding): the real
//! route (character-panel) and clothing (costume-strip) PICK screens are the
//! `select_objbtn` button-object ops themselves (NO inline option block); the
//! button-object-context `select_w` selects in the real corpus are
//! gallery / scene-jump / time-of-day menus. The SelectionControl ops do NOT
//! carry a route-vs-clothing discriminator, so pair-vs-grid is only a LAYOUT
//! arrangement of the placed option-buttons, not a semantic claim.
//!
//! [`SelectionControl`]: crate::rlop::module_catalog
//!
//! Every variant yields the same [`SelectLongOp`] carrier — the variant
//! distinction lives in the [`SelectVariant`] enum so audit tooling can
//! pin which opcode produced the queued longop without scraping the
//! private-state bytes.
//!
//! # Substrate-honesty posture
//!
//! - **No private wait loop.** Each op yields a typed
//!   [`DispatchOutcome::Yield`] carrying the [`SelectLongOp`]. The VM
//!   suspends through the substrate's longop queue + scheduler combo;
//!   no thread::sleep, no busy-poll, no host clock involvement.
//! - **Substrate input event.** The [`ChoiceInputScheduler`] consumes
//!   an [`InputEvent::Choice`] / [`ChoiceIndex`]; the engine port is
//!   the only path that calls `record_choice`.
//! - **Typed-resume store-register write.** The VM's step path decodes
//!   the popped longop's magic byte; the chosen index is written to
//!   `store_reg` via the typed `VarBanks::set_store` accessor.
//! - **Gameexe `SELBTN.NNN.*` styling.** Each emitted choice line is
//!   tagged with the styling fields the Gameexe defines for its index
//!   (e.g. `#SELBTN.000.*`). Missing entries fall back to a stable
//!   `choice:<idx>` text-surface label.
//!
//! # Tests
//!
//! - `choice_select_s_emits_three_options` (substrate ack): a synthetic
//!   `select_s` with three byte-string args emits 3 `TextLine` events
//!   (`text_surface = "choice:0/1/2"`) then suspends with a queued
//!   `SelectLongOp`.
//! - `choice_resume_writes_store_reg`: feeding `ChoiceIndex(1)` to the
//!   scheduler resumes the longop and writes `1` to the VM's store
//!   register; the pc advanced past the choice element on the original
//!   dispatch.
